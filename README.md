This app allows you to login with a chosen name or generate a random name.
It also allows you to create contacts, delete contacts, create conversations
with one or more people, delete said conversations, add messages as the
reciever (messages on the left side) or as the sender (messages on the right side).
This app also uses a custom hook to store information in local storage.

I used this app to help build my knowledge of react and react bootstrap and learned
how to efficiently use the useState, useEffect, useRef, and useContext hooks.
